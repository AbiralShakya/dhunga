native english speakers learning nepali adjacent, try hindi because more relevant data

needs ML pipeline to analyze hindi 

whisper for language identification, break down audio into phonetic components

quantitatively define clarity:
    ~ buzzword research: speech signals feature extraction. Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08798 
        they applied cnn and rnn and 'dnn' (lol)
            densenet - dense blocks, transition layers. feed forward connection. k(k+1)/2 connections for k layers. 
            multi dense net - multi task learning, train nn simultaneoiulsy learn multiple related task, backprop all graidents from all tasks together
            psa dense net - pyramid split attention module, EPSA net derived
                spcmodule channel seg, extract spatial info to generate multi scale features. divide MFCC feature map into s parts based on number of input channels (C),
                 reatins same shape as original feautre map, S feature maps, each contains C/S channels. spatial info -> convolution on feature maps of different scales. 
                 concatenate all multi scale feature maps, new multi scale fusion feature map is obtained. 
                SEWeight module - extract attention weights. squeeze and excitation. global average pooling applied to calculate mean of each channel, compressing feature maps into numerical info 
                 with shape 1 x1 x C. processed through two lienar layers with ReLU activation and sigmoid activation function to obtain weight for each channel.
